title: One Small Step
description: An optimistic campaign which promotes the power of a sustainable lifestyle, with the aim of encouraging young people to take action. Personal actions by many people can create a movement, and movements change the world. The main touchpoint is an app, which invites people to participate in weekly sustainable challenges. Users are encouraged to share their story through social media to use their own individual platform in the movement to normalise eco-consciousness.
