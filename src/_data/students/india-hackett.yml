  A3 publication about the impact of climate change on the local welsh heritage. Using photos from a family archive to tell a narrative of a specific bridge in Betws y Coed, North Wales. This project aimed to provide a subtle and evocative narrative through manipulated family archival photography about a local area and how it had been affected through climate change. The project is bilingual, to reinforce the relationship of the photographs and the area they come from.

  Further work by India is featured in this year's Graphic Arts Publication.
