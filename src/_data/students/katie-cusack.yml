title: Cosplay
description: |
  Although Cosplay is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character, in reality it's much more than that –  its about play and learning from different people in the community to improve your own skills. However, although many people in the community are able to create masterpieces the majority of us have never had any kind of training. This process is explored for this project through the design of different tools created out of bright acrylic that are safe for cosplayers to use and come with a handy manual.

  Further work by Katie is featured in this year's Graphic Arts Publication.
