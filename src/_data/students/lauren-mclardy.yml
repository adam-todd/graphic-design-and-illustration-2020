title: Life on an Elderly Care Ward
description: |
  This picture book is based on the diaries of my sister who is a student nurse in Birmingham. The book and narrative is about the patients on the ward, giving a snapshot into the lives they have lived, their story and how age and disease has made life so different.

  Further illustrated picture book work by Lauren, about a community's memories of a 50 year old Olympic swimming pool in Coventry, is featured in this year's Graphic Arts Publication.
