title: You Are Here
description: |
  Along with showing the way, maps can be used to tell a story and narrate a personal experience. Today, with the development of satellites and GPS systems, we know so much about every surface on Earth that there are hardly any new territories to be discovered. However, the instinct to explore comes naturally for people and it is a source of inspiration for many artists to perceive a new type of passion: unconventional mapping. Self written, designed, printed, and bound, You Are Here is a wide-ranging collection of inventive maps and map-making processes. For the creation of a visual identity, a collection of maps  found on The British Museum's Flickr account was used to generate a pattern. In contrast to traditional map collections, bold fonts and contemporary design approaches create a more modern vision. Thus, bringing together the idea of classic maps and unconventional cartography.

  Other type design and editorial work by Gergana is featured in this year's Graphic Arts Publication.
