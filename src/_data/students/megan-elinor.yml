title: Ocean Spirits
description: |
 Coral bleaching due to climate change, pollution and over fishing is having a devastating effect on our oceans. Coral reefs all around the world are being destroyed, turning the once brightly coloured reefs into white, skeletal graveyards. The purposeful shift of colours within the garments and headdresses, from sharp and vibrant to dull and grey, captures the visual shift in colour the reef endures due to bleaching. With the use of plastic jellyfish in the white garment it illustrates the negative impact climate change is having on ocean wildlife who rely on the reefs to survive. As jellyfish, who thrive off warm sea temperatures, may be the only thing left in the ocean.
