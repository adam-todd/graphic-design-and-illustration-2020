title: Ek Onkar
description: Ek Onkar, is the concept of God is one, and we are all one. This is it loosely translated in English. In this project I embraced what my Sikh identity is to help others understand it from an internal perspective by looking at the words of our Guru and the feelings this invokes in many Sikhs. Two publications compliment the animation and tie all my thoughts together. The turban is the outer identity of a Sikh, yet we have a spiritual side which is invoked through music and meditation.
