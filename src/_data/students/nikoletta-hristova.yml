title: Rollei Font Family
description: |
 Rollei is a serif display font that draws inspiration from the unique Rollei 35 camera logo. It is characterized by the geometric shapes of its characters, light contrast of strokes, historic aura, and at the same time contemporary look. The serifs add a complimentary personal touch, elegance and distinctiveness.

 Further work by Nikoletta is featured in this year's Graphic Arts Publication.
