title: Smithdown & Liverpool - Photography Zines
description: |
 Liverpool and Smithdown was born out of the need to document an experience from the point of view of a foreign student in Liverpool. ‘Smithdown’ being my last residence focuses on more personal situations combined with digital elements (social media screenshots or news), on the other hand ‘Liverpool’ focuses only on photography and has more commercial aspirations.

 Further photography work by Montse is featured in this year's Graphic Arts Publication and has been selected by Open Eye Gallery to be digitally exhibited  as part of Independents Biennial 2020.
