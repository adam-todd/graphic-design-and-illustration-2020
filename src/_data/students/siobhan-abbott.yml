title: EASY
description: EASY is the future of packaging. A new range which is accessible to everyone. The aim is to make packaging inclusive, meaning everyone can use it regardless of age, gender, disability or any other factors that prevent people from living an easy life. This packaging range introduces a new way of making design enjoyable and useful for everyone as well as looking good on the shelf. The easy-open techniques allow for everyone to use everyday essentials with minimal effort and struggle. The brand concept also includes type specifications and a colour palette which is friendly to the partially sighted and colour blind.
