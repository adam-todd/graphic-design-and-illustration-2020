        <h2>Degree Show 2020</h2>
        <p class="pt-3">Obviously the Covid-19 crisis has had an enormous impact on all our students this year, no group more so than our final year students. Midway through their final semester and the culmination of their studies they were forced to work in isolation on their final major project and their portfolio without the access to the extensive range of traditional and digital graphic arts equipment and facilities that we take for granted. Despite this, the 3rd Years responded exceptionally well to the new online structures and support methods producing excellent work for their final projects.</p>
        <p>However, not being able to have the traditional degree show has been a huge disappointment for all concerned. Every year, for decades, cohorts of students from across the UK have had a similar degree show experience. This year is different, and this website can never replace that traditional degree show experience. Nevertheless, the situation has given us the opportunity to produce something with more longevity. Something that will last beyond that time over the summer when the display tables and plinths are put away, the large format prints are taken down and the vinyl lettering is scraped off of the wall.</p>
        <p>Hopefully this website, which features each student's final project, links to their personal online portfolios, and this year's Graphic Arts Publication, will go some small way to celebrate their achievements and mark their transition from students to professionals.</p>
