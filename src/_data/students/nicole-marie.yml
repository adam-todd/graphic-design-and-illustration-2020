title: Digital Dérive
description: A publication of photographic studies using Google maps, taken in an attempt to complete an urban study of the L7 area of Liverpool using the 'psychogeography' technique of the dérive. When the restrictions of the world meant we were all heavily relying on technology and the digital world to help us continue to function, the results became a study in themselves about exploring environments digitally and the freedom and restrictions of doing so. As well as allowing continued research into L7, the studies lead to other questions&#58; How accurately can digital mapping recreate real life? Could the same perspectives be achieved? How is the environment distorted?
