title: Powerplant
description: |
 Product design and branding concept for vegan food aimed particularly at a reluctant male audience. It taps into the widespread interest, not least in a COVID-19 world, in eating as a pathway to health and strength (Powerplant), negotiating the notions of hyper-masculinity. Using a deliberately simple, pseudo-pharmaceutical design, the focus is the asterisk *, informing consumers that plant-based food closely emulates the experience of eating meat and dairy, while suggesting swear words in relation to the personal and global consequences of a non-vegan diet.

 Other graphic design work by Hannah is featured in this year's Graphic Arts Publication.
