title: The Friends of Amai Isles
description: Ongoing personal project to develop a group of cute animal characters who live in their own world, similar to Beatrix Potter’s characters and Tove Jansson’s Moomins. The animals have been crafted as felt wool dolls and are used as characters in a picture book narrative.
