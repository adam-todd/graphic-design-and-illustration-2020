title: Inter-face&#58; The Changing Face of Digital Identity
description: Inter-face is a research project looking at digital identity and how we display ourselves online. Controlled by algorithms, analytics and pattern recognition, users are drawn to their screens and engrossed within a virtual platform. Lost online, we are presented with the opportunity to reinvent ourselves and alter our identity; meaning we are able to construct an idealised version of ourselves and how we want to appear. Particularly during the restrictions placed upon us by Covid-19, our normality has been limited and we have become even more reliant on technology and the digital world in order to continue to exist and function. Research has been documented across a series of zines and distilled within 'Inter-face'; a x32 page publication. Printed in duo-tone magenta and navy on off-white stock varying 120-140gsm, with vellum tip-ins and cover, perfect bound. Due to the interactive nature of the online world, I wanted to explore how I could respond to the notion of warping our identity and altering how we appear within the realms of the virtual world. I designed x5 Augmented Reality filters, compatible with Instagram. Each digital filter offers a different outcome, whether that be animated, illustrated, typographical or interactive via touch; the filters individually respond to a particular area of focus within Inter-face.
