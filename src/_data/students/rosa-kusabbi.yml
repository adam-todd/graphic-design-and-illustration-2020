title: Women of Punk
description: |
  A response to  the impact female Punk bands had during the 70's Punk movement. A personal homage to bands such as 'The Slits' and 'Bush Tetras' highlighting the influence these bands had that's often written out of history. They inspired so many women to rebel and be creative and it's a legacy that continues to live on today.

  Further animation work by Rosa, exploring the loneliness and the mundanity of the day-to-day, is featured in this year's Graphic Arts Publication.
